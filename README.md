# Number_guess_game
A simple C program where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program gives hints like "too high" or "too low" until the correct number is guessed, and displays the total number of attempts taken. Great for learning input, loops, and randomization.

A very good beginner friendly , project..
